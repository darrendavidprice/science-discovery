  - {CERN-LHC.  Measurements of fiducial and differential cross section for top-quark pair production with additional heavy-favour jets in the dilepton and lepton+jets decay channels in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with 36.1 fb^-1 of data collected in 2015 and 2016. The paper is here "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12113v1.pdf" with the link to auxiliary material "https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/TOPQ-2017-12/"}
