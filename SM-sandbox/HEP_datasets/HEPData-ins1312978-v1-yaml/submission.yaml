comment: |
  A measurement of the production processes of the recently discovered Higgs boson is performed in the two-photon final state using 5.4 fb-1 of proton-proton collisions data at sqrt(s)=7 TeV and 20.3 fb-1 at sqrt(s)=8 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider.

  The signal strength for a Higgs boson of mass mH = 125.4 GeV decaying via H->gammagamma as measured in the individual analysis categories, and the combined signal strength, for the combination of the 7 TeV and 8 TeV data. The VH dilepton category is not shown because with only two events in the combined sample, the fit results are not meaningful.
